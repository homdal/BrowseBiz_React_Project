# Homdal React Project

This project was created using React and MaterialUI.

## Getting Started

Once you open the project on Github Pages you will find yourself on the home page,
where you can browse through business cards.\
Clicking on the business card's title allows you visit their business page for more information.\
The website's theme can be changed from light to dark and back by flipping the switch located on the header next to the login/register button.
You can also use the search bar on the 'Home Page', which is located to the left of the theme switch and expands when clicked on, it will
search through the cards to find those whose title matches to the value given.

## Login and Registration

By clicking the login/register button at the top right, you will find yourself on the login page
and can switch to registration either by clicking the same button again or by using the link at the bottom of the form,
the same can be done to return to the login.\
Clicking the 'Check' button will run a validation check on all the fields which will highlight those that have a mistake,
if no mistakes are found then the 'Send' button is enabled which will send the information to the API.

## Card Actions

Once you are logged in, you can start adding cards to your favorites page by clicking on the heart icon at the bottom of each card (icon is not visible to offline guests),
clicking it again on the same card will remove it from favorites, the same will happen if done on the favorites page.\
If the user registered as a business then he can go to the 'Creat Card' page to make their own business card,
after filling out the required fields in the creation form, which works similarliy to the login/registration, and sending the information,
a message will appear notifying the user if the card is created. Afterwards the user can view their card on either 'My Cards' page or the home page.
The user can then either favorite, edit or delete their card by clicking the corresponding icons at the bottom of the card which have helpful tooltips to know which is which,
these three actions can be done on all three pages:'Home Page', 'Favorites' and 'My Cards'.

## User Actions

The user can view their information on the 'Profile Page' that is accessed via a menu that opens by clicking the avatar icon in the top right corner of the page once logged in,
in the same menu the user can choose to log out.
